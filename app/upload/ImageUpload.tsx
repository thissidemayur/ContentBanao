/********************* FILE UPLOADING FLOW ********************

/**
 * ‚úÖ Why we pass `onSuccess` and `onProgress` to FileUploadBase?
 * 
 * - FileUploadBase doesn't return values ‚Äî it runs upload logic and calls our
 *   `onSuccess` and `onProgress` functions during the process.
 * 
 * - This is called a "callback" pattern: we tell it "what to do when done".
 * 
 *   üîÅ onProgress(progress: number) gets called continuously during upload
 *   ‚úÖ onSuccess(res: any) gets called when upload is finished
 * 
 * - These functions are passed as props, not values.
 *   We're NOT passing the upload result ‚Äî we're passing what to do when the result arrives.
 *
 * üí° This makes FileUploadBase reusable for images, videos, forms, etc.
 * 
 A callback is a function you pass to another function/component so that it can call it later ‚Äî typically when some async work (like upload) is done.
